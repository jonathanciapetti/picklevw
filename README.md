# picklevw
A very simple and crude reader with GUI for pickle files

It's just a mega code snippet, I still have huge work to be done - not just polishing - on this project, but at least it works.

There are no tests, nothing: it's my first attempt to work on desktop applications for Ubuntu.

StackOverflow answers FTW :-D
