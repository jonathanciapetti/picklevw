# picklevw
A reader + GUI for pickle files

It's just a mega code snippet, I still have huge work to be done - not just polishing - on this project, but at least it works.

There are no tests, nothing: it's my first attempt to work on desktop applications for Ubuntu.

Change permissions of pickleview.sh to make it executable for your desired user (like yourself).

### Install it:
$ git clone https://github.com/jonathanciapetti/picklevw.git

### Virtual environment:
$ python3 -m venv ./venv

$ venv/bin/active

### Install the dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run:
$ ./pickleview.sh
# picklevw
# picklevw
# picklevw
