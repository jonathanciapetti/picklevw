# picklevw
A reader + GUI for pickle files

It's just a mega code snippet, I still have huge work to be done - not just polishing - on this project, but at least it works.

There are no tests, nothing: it's my first attempt to work on desktop applications for Ubuntu.

1. ### Virtual environment:
    $ python3 -m venv ./venv

$ venv/bin/active

2. ### Dependencies installation
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. ### Launcher permission:
$ chmod +x ./pickleview.sh

4. ### Run:
$ ./pickleview.sh
# picklevw
# picklevw
# picklevw
